# Third-party notices

`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` adapts Contributor Covenant 3.0 under CC BY-SA 4.0.
Its separate policy-text license does not change the JSON Quality code's AGPL-3.0-only license.

Repository Markdown development tooling uses `@hadden-industries/markdown-quality` (AGPL-3.0-only) from the exact source recorded in `tooling/markdown/source.json`.
Its retained core and platform archives include their upstream notices, native component inventories and source-offer material.
This isolated development graph is not included in the JSON Quality npm package.

JavaScript runtime dependencies are Ajv (MIT) and Prettier (MIT).
ESLint (MIT) and its official JSON plugin (Apache-2.0) are development dependencies; the latter supports the immutable finite-v1 test oracle and is not a runtime JSON reader.
The independent test oracle Momoa is Apache-2.0 and is a direct development dependency.
Dependency-cruiser (MIT) is a development dependency used for affected-test selection and architecture enforcement; it is not a runtime dependency.
Native npm installation retains dependency licence files; dependency versions and integrity are frozen in `package-lock.json`.
The final transported dependency graph and applicable source/notice delivery must be reviewed before consumer activation or distribution.

The shared native component incorporates Boost 1.92.0 (Boost Software License 1.0), ICU 79.1 and its Unicode 18 data (the upstream ICU/Unicode license and included third-party notices), SQLite 3.54.1 (public-domain dedication), and double-conversion 3.4.0 (BSD-style license).
Node-API headers/import-library inputs retain the pinned Node.js license and upstream notices; the host Node runtime remains separately acquired.
The build statically links the selected core libraries into the Node-API module and framed executable; it does not select global ICU or SQLite at runtime.

`native/dependencies.json` records exact source URLs, SHA-256 pins, roles and acquisition bounds.
Each staged platform payload retains its dependency notices, component manifest and build evidence.
Those records bind compiled source/control identities and actual output hashes; the producer retains original source archives and build logs separately.
The source integration, build and staging tools are shipped under `native/` so a recipient can inspect and reproduce the selected integration from the declared upstream inputs.
Producer-only ICU Windows data-generation tools are not a consumer runtime dependency.

These notices describe source and payload ownership.
Final rights review, complete transported notices/source delivery, platform qualification and release authorization remain separate acceptance obligations.
